Secrect Sector Ideas

Replaces crystal homeworlds (and maybe Crystalmen)

1 - Mantis-Fed War
Player is in middle of the mantis Federation war. Helps Feds defeat mantis

2 - Lanius Invasion
Sector is overtaken with Lanius. Rebel fleet is torn to pieces. Very hostile.

3 - Silence Sector
Would be a sector overtaken by the silence (see below)



New Factions/Races

Replaces existing race or adds a new faction to the game

1 - The Silence
Completely invisible reskin of the Crystalmen. (And maybe replaces Lanius???)

2 - Authortarian Crystals
Rock Homeworlds taken back by crystalmen.


New Enemy

Replaces the rebellion fleet with another enemy

1 - Noone expects the Zoltan Inquisition
The Zoltans are taking universal 'peace' into their own hands and taking it under the zoltan empire.

2- Mantis Fleet
